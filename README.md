This project aims to model the progression of diabetes using independent variables from the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library. By developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), we can predict how diabetes progresses in patients based on various factors. The insights from this model can help healthcare professionals better understand the underlying patterns of diabetes progression and potentially improve treatment strategies.
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library, which includes 442 samples and 10 baseline variables (age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, etc.). The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
